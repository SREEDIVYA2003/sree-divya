The Restaurant Reservation System is a React-based web application that allows customers to make table reservations by entering their name, phone number, and guest count. It dynamically updates the available seats as reservations are made or checked out. The system features a menu section where users can browse and order food items, along with an option to add them to their order. Reservations are displayed in a table with options to check out or delete them, and the available seats adjust accordingly. The app ensures smooth interaction with user input validation, responsive design, and a modern user interface, providing a complete solution for managing restaurant reservations.
